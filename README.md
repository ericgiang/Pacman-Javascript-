The goal of this project is to take our Pacman game from Java and translate it into Javascript with roughly the same functionality, such as having walls, a 'pacman' character, 
collision detection and fixing, adding ghosts, pellets, fruits. 
Problems so far: 
  The issue I am currently dealing with can be seen in the screenshots. My pacman will collide with a wall and instead of just being sent back to its previous location 
  before the collision, he is sprung up and back, amounting to him being sent back to his previous position, but then even further. Until i get my collision detection for Pacman and Walls
  working, I cannot move forward.
